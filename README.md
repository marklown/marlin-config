# Marlin Configs

This repo contains the Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h files I am currently using on an Ender-5 plus with the following hardware modifications:

- Main board upgraded to BTT SKR Mini E3 V3
- BLTouch plugged in to Z End Stop
- BTT TFT35 screen

The compiled firmware is built from the bugfix-2.1.x branch.
